This example demonstrates a common error in TypeScript where type guards are missing to correctly check the type of an object before accessing its properties. The `calculateArea` function attempts to access properties specific to different shapes without checking the actual type of the shape passed in.  The solution shows how to properly implement type guards to fix the issue and provide type safety.
